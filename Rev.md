###GDB Baby Step 1

I had the most fun learning reverse engineering and the use of GDB seemed fun so this problem should be easy I guess. So we have to look for the hexadecimal value stored in the eax register. The porblem gives us a debugger0_a file which is executable. I opened the file on gdb and looked for information all the functions. Well GDB disassbembly by default is set to AT&T syntax, I changed it to intel so as it's more familiar and easy to read. Then I disassembled main. The eax register stored the value '0Ã—86342'.

As per the problem, the flag should be closed in decimal so I converted the hexadecimal value to decimal and got the flag.

The flag-'picoCTF{549698}'

###ARMssembly 0

I learnt a bit of Assembly Language but I wasn't able to read ARM Assembly. So I resorted to looking at the solution and learnt how it works. Basically the code was printing the number the larger number 'w0'. The flag could be obtained by converting the decimal number to hexadecimal.

The flag-'picoCTF{E5C69CD8}'

###keygenme-py

So looking at the python file, It is likely that if the key check trial return true, it will lead us to the flag. We already have a portion of the flag and the last 8 characters in it are to be found. The key can be reverse engineered from the check_key function and the below code can give us the the last 8 characters of the flag.

The flag-'picoCTF{1n_7h3_|<3y_of_e584b363}'
